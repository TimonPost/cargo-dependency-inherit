# Cargo Workspace Dependency Inheritor

Utility that inherits dependencies from the main workspace if they occur `n` or more times in the workspace.

Workspace Inheritance was stabilized in version 1.64.
See [`[workspace.package]`][1], [`[workspace.dependencies]`][2], and [inheriting-a-dependency-from-a-workspace][3] for more information.

## How to Use

To inherit a dependency that occurs five or more times in the workspace, use the following command:

(currently some issues using it via cargo subcommand, download this lib and compile it your self instead)

```bash
cargo install cargo-dependency-inheritor
cargo dependency-inheritor --workspace-path "path/to/workspace/Cargo.toml" -n 5
```

**This command edits your toml files, make sure to have a back up**

## Process

Dependencies can be inherited from a workspace by specifying the dependency in the workspace's [`[workspace.dependencies]`][2] table. After that, add it to the `[dependencies]` table with workspace = true.
This crate automates the process.

1. Read packages defined in `[workspace]` section of the workspace-file.
2. Note which dependencies occur `n` or more times.
3. Update all dependencies that occurred `n` or more times:
   1. Turn `dependency = "0.1.3"` into inline tables.
   2. Add `workspace = true` key-value to the dependency inline table.
   3. Remove `version` from inline table if exists (this will be specified in the workspace file).
4. Add [`[workspace.dependencies]`][2] table to root workspace file with all the dependencies that occurred `n` times and their version.

Result:

```toml
# in a project
[dependencies]
tokio = { workspace = true }

# in the workspace
[workspace.dependencies]
tokio = "1.0"
```
